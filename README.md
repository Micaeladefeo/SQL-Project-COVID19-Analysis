# SQL Project: Covid Analysis

## Introduction
  The COVID casualties and vaccination statistics are two essential datasets that this SQL project will explore in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. SQL queries and data manipulation will be used throughout the project while looking for correlations between vaccination rates and mortality rates across various geographical areas.

## Datasets
1. COVID Deaths Dataset: Includes information on individuals who have passed away from COVID-19. It contains relevant details such as date, population, and location. The intensity and effects of the virus on various demographic segments can be observed within this dataset.

2. Vaccination Dataset: The COVID-19 immunization efforts are described in the vaccination dataset. It includes data on the number of individuals vaccinated, vaccination dates and geographic areas. This dataset makes it possible to evaluate the vaccination coverage in various groups and regions.

## Objectives
-The project's primary objectives are as follows:
  1. Of the positive Covid cases registered, how many were fatal.
  2. Percentage of the population that contracted Covid.
  3. Countries with the highest infection rate and highest death count per population.
  4. Continent that presents the highest mortality rate.
  5. Relationship between total population and vaccinations.

## Expected Deliverables
Upon completion of the project, the following deliverables will be provided:

1. SQL Queries and Data Manipulation: In order to extract, filter, aggregate, and alter the data as needed for the analysis, SQL queries will be created and run. These queries will guarantee the effective retrieval of pertinent data from the databases.

2. Data Visualizations: To portray the analyzed data in a thorough and understandable way, visualizations in Tableau will be created. The links, patterns, and trends identified via the analysis will be better understood with the use of these visualizations.
